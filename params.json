  "body": "HackTheArch \r\n===========\r\n\r\n![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mcpa-stlouis/hack-the-arch.svg?branch=dev)\r\n![Heroku](https://heroku-badge.herokuapp.com/?app=hackthearch&svg=1)\r\n\r\nThis is a scoring server built using Ruby on Rails by the Military Cyber\r\nProfessionals Association (MCPA).  It is free to use and extend under the MIT\r\nlicense (see LICENSE file).  The goal of this project is to provide a standard\r\ngeneric scoring server that provides an easy way to add and modify problems and\r\ntrack statistics of a Cyber Capture the Flag event.  While it's not\r\nrecommended, this server can be hosted with your challenges but we do recommend\r\nsand-boxing your challenges so they do not affect the scoring server.\r\n\r\n**Want to see it in action?  Live Demo hosted\r\n[here](https://hta-demo.mcpa-stl.org)!**\r\n\r\nWhat's different about HackTheArch?\r\n-----------------------------------\r\nWe created this application after using the [PicoCTF\r\nplatform](https://github.com/picoCTF/picoCTF-Platform-2) for our annual CTF.\r\nIt was okay, but we found it lacking some features that we wanted.  We wanted a\r\nway to be able to offer competitors hints for a cost, and we also wanted a way\r\nto create and modify problems from a web interface.  We looked around and\r\ndidn't see any others that met our requirements.\r\n[CTFd](https://github.com/isislab/CTFd): no web admin interface for creating\r\nchallenges.  [Root The Box](https://github.com/moloch--/RootTheBox): We didn't\r\nlike all the extra stuff with the bank accounts and it just seemed too complex\r\nfor our needs.  So we decided to roll our own scoring server and now you can\r\nbenefit from our hard work!  This application implements an optional dynamic\r\nhint system which will deduct points for requesting hints and also implements a\r\nweb interface for creating and modifying hints and challenges.  We hope you\r\nenjoy this application and are open to feedback so let us know what you like,\r\nhate, would like to see added, etc...\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n------------\r\n* Ruby version 2.3.1p112\r\n* Activation and password reset e-mails depend on Heroku SendGrid add-on\r\n  configuration (this feature can be optionally disabled or easily modified to\r\n  be used with other mailers)\r\n* To store challenge pictures in the production environment, you'll need to\r\n  modify 'config/initializers/carrier\\_wave.rb' to work with your cloud storage\r\n  solution\r\n* See Gemfile for further requirements\r\n\r\nDeployment Options\r\n==================\r\nGetting Started\r\n---------------\r\n* For the latest stable release either download the latest tagged release\r\n  [here](https://github.com/mcpa-stlouis/hack-the-arch/releases), or checkout\r\n  the 'master' branch.  For the latest features and a less-stable version,\r\n  checkout the 'dev' branch.\r\n* This app is presently designed to be deployed in a heroku environment.  We\r\n  highly recommend this configuration.  A few things must be configured to\r\n  deploy to Heroku:\r\n\r\n  1.  Create a `HOST` environment variable that contains the url for your app\r\n      (e.g., HOST=hackthearch.herokuapp.com).\r\n  2.  For mailer support, add the sendgrid addon before deploying (`heroku\r\n      addons:create sendgrid:starter`).  More info on Sendgrid\r\n      [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-ruby#set-up).\r\n  3.  For live streaming (submissions, chat, etc...), add the Redis To Go\r\n      addon.\r\n  \r\n* It can be deployed outside a heroku environment but will require some\r\n  alternative for sending account activation e-mails (or alternatively\r\n  activation e-mails can be disabled in the admin console)\r\n* To initialize the database, run: `bundle exec rake db:seed`.  After\r\n  initialization, the admin login credentials will be: **admin@gmail.com** :\r\n  **password**\r\n* **Important**: It is highly advised that you change the admin credentials\r\n  post-deployment\r\n* For other deployment options, keep reading.\r\n\r\nDocker \r\n------\r\n![Docker](https://images.microbadger.com/badges/image/paullj1/hackthearch.svg)\r\n\r\n* A Dockerfile is included along with a docker-compose.yml for deploying a\r\n  containerized version of HackTheArch.  More detailed instructions can be\r\n  found in: [DOCKER_README.md](https://github.com/mcpa-stlouis/hack-the-arch/blob/dev/DOCKER_README.md).\r\n\r\n### More configuration details on our project [wiki](https://github.com/mcpa-stlouis/hack-the-arch/wiki).\r\n\r\nContribute and Contact\r\n======================\r\nWant to help?\r\n-------------\r\n* Want to add a new feature or fix a bug? Check out a branch and submit working\r\n  code with tests via pull request to merge into the 'dev' branch.\r\n* Check out the [slack](https://hack-the-arch.slack.com) channel for more.\r\n* Test coverage would be a good place to start: [here](coverage/index.html)\r\n\r\nContact\r\n-------\r\n* [Paul Jordan](http://paullj1.com) @ paullj1[at]gmail[dot]com\r\n* [Raymond Evans](http://CyDefe.com) @ REvans[at]CyDefe[dot]com\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements\r\n----------------\r\n* Base code derived from the [Rails Tutorial](http://railstutorial.org) by\r\n  Michael Hartl",
